# Dog vs Cats Image Classification

This repository contains code for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained to classify images of dogs and cats. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and it utilizes the concept of transfer learning with a pre-trained CNN architecture (such as VGG16, ResNet50, etc.) for feature extraction and classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training consists of images of dogs and cats obtained from [link to dataset]. The dataset is divided into training and validation sets, and each image is labeled as either a dog or a cat.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers for feature extraction. Batch normalization and dropout layers are used for regularization to prevent overfitting. The final layers include fully connected (dense) layers with softmax activation for classification.

## Training

The model is trained using the training dataset and validated using the validation dataset. During training, data augmentation techniques such as random rotation, scaling, and horizontal flipping are applied to increase the model's robustness and generalization capability.

## Evaluation

The trained model's performance is evaluated on the validation dataset using metrics such as accuracy and loss. Additionally, visualizations of training and validation metrics (accuracy and loss) are provided to analyze the model's learning progress and identify overfitting.

## Usage

To train the model:

```bash
python train.py
```

To make predictions on new images:

```bash
python predict.py /path/to/image.jpg
```

Replace `/path/to/image.jpg` with the path to the image you want to classify.
